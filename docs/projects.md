# Projects and Services
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD025 MDO26 -->

Comfora hosts a couple of projects on both on [GitHub](https://github.com/comfora) and our own infrastructure which allows us to bring community members more **reliability** and **transparent with operations.** Couple of things to note,

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD007 -->
- We do not publicly expose what **internal services** we use as to provide some security and reduce strain on internal services **hosted on our infrastructure.**
    - We do use public open-source projects which can be found on GitHub or we also sometimes use closed-source projects.
    - Some internal services will be however announced publicly as to bring transparency of what services we use.
- Most services we run are also open-source projects in which you get to see be mention under [Services.](#services)
- Some services are closed-source *which we hate* however, brings us service which is vital within our operations

??? question "Why do this?"
    As part of the [Comfora Mission,](about.md/#comfora-mission) we want to be more honest and transparent in the services we run, host services, or services we buy plans from. As we would like to tell our entire stack, there are some security concerns and services that, in theory, could be found easily, but we prefer for the service to be out of the public's attention.
