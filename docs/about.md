<!-- markdownlint-enable MD025 MDO26 -->

Established in June 2025, the Comfora Organization is committed to bringing developers open-source projects
that improves their development cycle or proves be to helpful. Big or small projects, we support any Comfora Projects.

## Comfora Mission

We believe that open-source is the future of development and are major believers of open-source initiatives
created such as the [open source initiative](https://opensource.org/) and many more. We also believe
development is funded by,

- **Transparency** and honesty.
- **Community collaboration** and networking.
- Having people have a say in our **governance and management.**

## F^^k *Generative* AI

Better known as our **Responsible AI Usage** policy at Comfora, we are committed to not using artificial intelligence for graphical generations (such as AI pictures, videos, nor audio) on any of our **social platforms, community, and websites (docs included).** Art and graphics are the backbone of creativity, and we do not support AI models stealing artists or graphic designers work without payment.

However the intelligence of Agentic and Text-Based AI is unparalleled, so thus, **we use AI for the following:**

- Small code generations in our projects; we don't generate full functions or packages from AI for security reasons.
