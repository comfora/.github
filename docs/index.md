:comfora-logo: *Comfora* is a **Community Powered** organization designed to bring developers open-source projects with extensive community support and transparent governance in mind.
So while other organizations or companies tries to outcast the community, we embrace the community.

## Open Governance in Mind

We're a open-source community of developers coming together and developing cool projects, it's what we love to-do. However, corporations and private equity are sadly
ruining open-source by outright refusing to listen on how **the community is affected.**

We aim to **change that.** Since our inception in June 2025, Comfora has and will be listening to the community, no matter if the community is mad or not.

!!! Danger "Moving away from Material for MkDocs to Zensical"

    **TL;DR Project maintainers have put [Material for MkDocs in Maintenance Mode](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material/issues/8523) in favor of developing Zensical.**

    We are beginning to move to Zensical meaning certain aspects of the original website are now gone *temporarily*
    as we focus on migrating to a new system. Please bear with us.
